# A-COMPARATIVE-STUDY-OF-LSTM-VS-XLSTM-VS-BILSTM-IN-SHORT-TERM-PASSENGER-FLOW-FORECASTING-IN-URT

**DESCRIPTION:**
Passenger flow forecasting is an important task of subway managers to
improve passenger traffic efficiency by organizing the passenger flow
and assign capacity resources. The Short-Term passenger flow
forecasting plays one of the vital role for efficient operation and
planning in Urban Rail Transit systems, that analyze the passengers
peek working hours and adjust the train timetables. This study provides
a comparative analysis of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Extended Long ShortTerm Memory (XLSTM), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)
networks for short-term passenger forecasting in urban rail transit. The analysis
leverages five consecutive weeks of historical passenger data from a major urban
rail network to evaluate the predictive performance of all three models. Key
performance metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE), and Weighted Mean Percentage Error (WMAPE), are used to assess
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that while all three methods outperform
traditional time series forecasting methods, each model has distinct strengths. The
LSTM model excels at capturing long-term dependencies and temporal
correlations, making it ideal for sequence prediction tasks. The XLSTM model
shows superior performance in capturing fluctuations in passenger flow.
Meanwhile, the BiLSTM model benefits from processing information from both
past and future time steps, resulting in the highest predictive accuracy. These
findings underscore the potential of advanced neural network architectures to
enhance the reliability of short-term passenger forecasts, thereby contributing to
more responsive and adaptive urban rail transit management.
The comparative studey of LSTM VS XLSTM VS BiLSTM for passenger flow forecasting in URT is briefly defines in the above codes and define the best result by comparing the 3 models and define the best model to reduce the traffic congeston in the city.
